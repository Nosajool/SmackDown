SmackDown
=========

2 Player Java game made by David Fu &amp; Jason Loo




The idea of the game is to smash your opponent into the ground. 

When they are on the ground, they are invulnerable so you need to dash into them and "trip" them

up into the air so that you can smash them back down.


Controls are:


P1:

A-action
S-move left
F-move right
E-jump
D-dodge


P2: 
H-action
J-move left
L-move right
I-jump
K-dodge

You can double jump.
Your action button is a dash when you are on the ground and a smack down when you are in the air.
When you are in the air, you are vulnerable to being smacked down.
If you get "tripped", you are "helpless" and cannot jump or use your smack down until you touch the ground again.

P1 & P2 key input are optimized for right handed players.
